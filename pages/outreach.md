__Part of our mission is to share insights from our work through engagement and outreach activities.__

### Research Blog 
In our research blogs series we tell the story of our research, present our findings and the impact our work has on industry, policy-makers and citizens, as well as future implications. It is an in-depth exploration of how we investigate security and privacy issues and develop methods for solving these problems. 

### Podcast 
“Always Listening - Can I trust my AI Assistant?” is podcast series produced to address the normal concerns users of voice AI assistant as well as the business and academic communities have. Through example driven explanations and comments from the SAIS team and their industry partners we discuss the technology, privacy issues and future of the industry for a non-scientific audience. We explore essential questions about security and privacy in voice AI assistants, with a particular focus on data from users and the security and privacy implications that these raise. Highlights include explaining the AI Assistant ecosystem, looking at Amazon Alexa as an example, and highlighting security measures in place as well as areas to be aware of. 

Coming this January 2023.
