The successful candidate will join King’s College London and work on the EPSRC-funded project “SAIS: Secure AI Assistants”. 

There is an unprecedented integration of AI assistants into everyday life, from the personal AI assistants running on our smart phones and in our homes, to enterprise AI assistants for increased productivity in the workplace, to health AI assistants. In the UK alone, 7,000,000 users interact with AI assistants every day, and 13,000,000 users do so on a weekly basis. A crucial concern is how secure such AI assistants are, as they make extensive use of AI and learn continually.
 
SAIS (Secure AI assistantS) is a cross-disciplinary collaboration between the Departments of Informatics, Digital Humanities and The Policy Institute at King's College London, and the Department of Computing at Imperial College London, working with non-academic partners: Microsoft, Humley, Hospify, Mycroft, policy and regulation experts, and the general public, including non-technical users.
 
This two-year post will focus on symbolic and norm-based AI models to specify, dynamically monitor, and explain the desirable behaviour of AI assistants. The postholder will work most closely with Dr Natalia Criado, Prof Michael Luck, and Prof Jose Such but will also be expected to collaborate with the rest of the project team as appropriate.    
 
This post will be offered on a fixed-term contract for 2 years and is a full-time post.
