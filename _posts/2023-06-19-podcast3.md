teaser: "The relationships we build with our voice AI Assistants has been observed with great interest from the scientific community. These little machines have names, we talk to them like humans and trust them to do tasks for us. At the same time there is an inherent limit to what they can do for us and we might have decided not to trust them in certain situations. There are times when for example they have shared false information. "
